# OpenCV 3.x Installation Guide for MacOS (Python, C++)
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org) is an open source library for image processing thats supported in multiple languages. This guide explains installation steps for **C++** and **Python** only.

## [Optional] Optimisation for Deep Neural Nets
Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library) can be installed to accelerate computation performance. It can be obtained for free from the official [website](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/free-mkl) for dmg installation.

It can be installed from [source](https://github.com/01org/mkl-dnn) also.

Additionally IPP (Intel Performance Primitives) and TBB (Thread Building Blocks) can be installed for optimal code in multicore architectures from the same website linked above.

Install all these as `sudo` so the entire OS can take advantage of it. 

**DISCLAIMER:** Do this only if you understand what your doing since it becomes really difficult to uninstall these packages if ever needed to do so.

## Initial requirements

Before we can start downloading OpenCV we need ```brew``` to simplify our steps. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installs packages which are useful and isn't included by default by Apple.

Open Terminal and type to install Homebrew:

```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

We need to install ```wget``` in order to download OpenCV:

```
$ brew install wget
```

We need a few other additional packages:

```
$ brew install git cmake pkg-config jpeg libpng libtiff openexr eigen tbb
```


We first need to download OpenCV code in order to compile them for use with other languages.

1. Create an empty folder in **Documents** and name it **OpenCV**.
2. Open **Terminal** and navigate to this folder. </br> 
```$ cd Documents/OpenCV
``` 
3. Download OpenCV here by typing (replace 3.3.0 with latest) :</br>```$ wget https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.3.0.zip``` </br>
4. `$ unzip 3*.zip`

5. **[Optional]** Download OpenCV_Contrib by typing:</br>```$ wget https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib/archive/3.3.0.zip``` </br> and unzip this too.

## Compiling for Python
It is never a good idea to work with system Python so the ideal option would be to work on virtual environments or different Pythons.

1. Go to the website [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and download Python 3.x 64-Bit (bash installer). (You can choose Python 2.x also.)
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder where this was downloaded usually its the Downloads folder.  </br>
```$ cd Downloads/
```
3. 
```$ bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
4. Just type `yes` whenever asked during installation. This will add the new Python to your *PATH*. This will shadow your system python. You can always remove this later on if ever needed by commenting the miniconda line in *.bash_profile* file.
5. Once the installation is done, we need to activate the new PATH settings. This is done by:</br>

 ```
 $ cd ~
 $  . .bash_profile
 ``` 
6. If all goes well, you can test it by typing ```
$ conda info``` 
to get an output like this:</br>

 ```
Current conda install:

               platform : osx-64
          conda version : 4.3.22
       conda is private : False
      conda-env version : 4.3.22
    conda-build version : not installed
         python version : 3.6.1.final.0
       requests version : 2.14.2

                UID:GID : 501:20
```
7. OpenCV requires numpy which is installed by:</br>

 ```
$ conda install numpy
 ```
8. Now that we have everything, we can compile OpenCV for Python. Navigate to the folder where we extracted OpenCV:</br>
 
 ```
 $ cd Documents/OpenCV/opencv*
 ```
9. ```$ mkdir release```
10. ```$ cd release```
11. <p>Cmake command to compile:

```
$ cmake -DBUILD_TIFF=ON -DBUILD_opencv_java=OFF -DWITH_CUDA=OFF -DENABLE_AVX=ON -DWITH_OPENGL=ON -DWITH_OPENCL=ON -DWITH_IPP=ON -DWITH_TBB=ON -DWITH_EIGEN=ON -DWITH_V4L=ON -DWITH_VTK=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_opencv_python2=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") -DPYTHON3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) -DPYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python3 -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_inc; print(get_python_inc())") -DPYTHON3_PACKAGES_PATH=$(python3 -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())") ..
```
To compile with contrib (if you followed **optional** step):

**NOTE:** Change the path accordingly, in my case it was:

```
-DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=/Users/rakshithgb/Documents/OpenCV/opencv_contrib-3.3.0/modules
```
Replace this path and add it to your cmake command like this:
 
```
$ cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=/Users/rakshithgb/Documents/OpenCV/opencv_contrib-3.3.0/modules -DBUILD_TIFF=ON -DBUILD_opencv_java=OFF -DWITH_CUDA=OFF -DENABLE_AVX=ON -DWITH_OPENGL=ON -DWITH_OPENCL=ON -DWITH_IPP=ON -DWITH_TBB=ON -DWITH_EIGEN=ON -DWITH_V4L=ON -DWITH_VTK=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_opencv_python2=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") -DPYTHON3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) -DPYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python3 -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_inc; print(get_python_inc())") -DPYTHON3_PACKAGES_PATH=$(python3 -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())") ..
```

 To build for python 2 just change all the ```python3``` references to ```python2```.

 If everything compiles then you will not get any errors. Once its finished compiling make sure its building for python3/2 accordingly.</p>

12. ```$ make -j4```
13. ```$ make install```

Thats it, we can now use OpenCV with python.
Referenced the steps from [here](https://blog.kevin-brown.com/programming/2014/09/27/building-and-installing-opencv-3.html).

##### Errors
So when you ```import cv2``` in your python script if you get an error:</br>
> ImportError: /media/BigData/miniconda3/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.22â€™ not found (required by /media/BigData/miniconda3/lib/libopencv_objdetect.so.3.2)

Use a more up to date system libstdc++ by:

```
$ cd ~/miniconda3/lib
$ rm libstdc++.so.6
$ ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
``` 
If you get error:</br>
> /usr/include/c++/6/cstdlib:75:25: fatal error: stdlib.h: No such file or directory #include_next  

or
> ~/miniconda3/lib/libopencv_objdetect.so.3.2: undefined symbol: _ZTINSt6thread6_StateE

Then try using ```g++ 5```:</br>

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --config g++
$ sudo update-alternatives --config gfortran 
```
## Spyder IDE for Python
A good IDE for python. Official website link [here](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html).

If `.dmg` version isn't available then install using:

```
$ conda install pyqt
$ conda install spyder
```
Start the app from terminal after that by:


```
$ spyder
```

## Compiling for C++
First prerequisite is to install [MacPorts]( http://www.macports.org). Download and install it from the official website. Verify the installation by opening Terminal and typing `$ port` , you should get something like this: </br>

```
MacPorts 2.4.1
Entering shell mode... ("help" for help, "quit" to quit)
```
Now we have everything we need to compile for **C++**.

1. Navigate to the OpenCV directory where we extracted OpenCV: </br> ```$ cd Documents/OpenCV/opencv*```
2. ```$ mkdir build```
3. ```$ cd build```
4. Lets compile OpenCV now by typing:</br> ```$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..```
5. Once its successfully done execute:</br>```$ make -j8```
6. ```$ sudo make install```

Thats it OpenCV is compiled for c++ use now.
